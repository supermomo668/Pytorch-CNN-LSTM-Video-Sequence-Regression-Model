# CNN-LSTM-Video-Sequence-Regression-Model-Pytorch-
Use pre-trained CNN for feature extractor to train a regressive LSTM model to perform regressive task for video data

Simple PyTorch-based pipeline on creating vision-based sequence model to model a a regressive task by minimizing mean absolute error against features of your choice, with flexibility in settings on modelling/data-loading parameters.

Leverage pre-trained vision models (VGG-19, Resnet-50, MobileNet-v3 ...etc.) as feature extractors for input into the bi-directional Long-Short-Term-Memory Model.
